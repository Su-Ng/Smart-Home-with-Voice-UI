# Smart-Home-with-Voice-UI
What is the benefit of using voice activated Smart Bulb?
The fun of creating different custom lighting effects and making it convenient hands free control over your light. Just light a remote control, but better, because it uses your handphone.

The demo here shows that with a handphone and a smart bulb we can turn the bulb on, off and display different colours using voice.

Two apps are used to get this effect.
* Google Home
* Kasa Smart

This is to match the Kasa Smart bulb I am using.

The wake word used is "Hey Google", followed by 
* "Switch on the &lt;light name&gt;"
* "Turn the &lt;light name&gt; "blue"  
* "Switch off the &lt;light name&gt;"
