# Smart-Home-with-Voice-UI
This is a smart bulb connected to a voice user interface. The demo here shows that with a handphone and a smart bulb we can turn the bulb on, off and display different colours.

Two apps are used to get this effect.
* Google Home
* Kasa Smart

This is to match the Kasa Smart bulb I am using.

The wake word used is "Hey Google", followed by 
* "Switch on the &lt;light name&gt;"
* "Turn the &lt;light name&gt; "blue"  
* "Switch off the &lt;light name&gt;"
